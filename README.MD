# Git Challenge Code Refactor
## Refactoring webpage for Horiseon company.

--- Overview 
Given a code we will improve the webpage without actually changing what it is supposed to do. Make the webpage more accessible to meet the requirements for users with disabilities.

### The challenge:
A company has given me an objective to refactor a webpage to make it more accesible for people with disabilities. Given the objective, I will make changes to the code without actually changing the way the webpage looks like. Not only will this improve the webpage, but doing so will create the accessible requirements the company is looking for. 

### User story:
AS A marketing agency
I WANT a codebase that follows accessibility standards
SO THAT our own site is optimized for search engines

### Acceptance Criteria:
GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards
WHEN I view the source code
THEN I find semantic HTML elements
WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements
THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
WHEN I view the image elements
THEN I find accessible alt attributes
WHEN I view the heading attributes
THEN they fall in sequential order
WHEN I view the title element
THEN I find a concise, descriptive title

## My Process:
I removed all the <div> tags and replaced it with html sematic elements. Cleaned up the code to keep it dry. Edited the alt attributes. Added the source tag to the elements for example: when you click on search-engine-optimization, it directly takes you down to the source. 

### Built with 
~ html sematic elements: 
section, main, nav, aisde, header

### CSS:
padding, added aside classes to ensure images are properly displayed, use nav tags to give a navigation bar at the top of the page

### What I learned:
I learned how to use the inspect tool to have a clear picture on a webpage to display both it's html and css file to give me a better understanding on how to code, what I need to add or what I am missing. I have also learned how the alt attribute helps with understanding a picture for those who are visually impaired by just listening to a short, yet brief overview.
