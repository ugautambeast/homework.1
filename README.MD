### The challenge:
A company has given me an objective to refactor a webpage to make it more accesible for people with disabilities. Given the objective, I will make changes to the code without actually changing the way the webpage looks like. Not only will this improve the webpage, but doing so will create the accessible requirements the company is looking for.
